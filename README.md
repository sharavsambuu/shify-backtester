# About the shify backtester
Well, I needed to know whats going on behind the scene.
And also I want to iterate faster when trying new strategies.
In that regards, I've already tried some other libraries like Zipline etc
and I couldn't even bundle 1minute timeframe data but I still Zipline is good approach
This library gonna become Frankenstein monster so don't expect much.

So whats inside my mind are currently followings : 

    - Multi universe
    - Auto caching
    - Multi bars
    - Pluggable 
    - Extensible, ie add other trading cost calculation
    - Portfolio
    - Multi Strategy
    - Asynchronous
    - Configurable
    - Use common libraries like TALib, quantstats
